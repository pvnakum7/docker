Components of a Dockerfile

docker file mainly consist  4 
step command: FROM, ENV,RUN ,CMD

From--> FROM is used to define the base image to start the build 
		process. Every Dockerfile must start with the FROM instruction
		like : FROM ubuntu
ENV --> Command used to set the environment variables that is required 
		to run the project.	like : ENV HTTP_PORT="9000"

WORKDIR--> WORKDIR tells Docker that the rest of the commands will be 
			run in the context of the "/app" folder inside the image
			like: WORKDIR /path/to/workdir
			WORKDIR /app

RUN--> RUN has 2 forms:
		1-RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
    	2-RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
    	like : 
    	     RUN /bin/bash -c 'source $HOME/.bashrc; echo $HOME'

ENTRYPOINT-->ENTRYPOINT has 2 forms:
				You can override ENTRYPOINT instructions using the 
				"docker run --entrypoint"
    		1-: ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form, preferred)
    		2-: ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form) 
    		like :
    		ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "echo $HOME" ]

 CMD --> The CMD instruction has three forms:
 		    1-:CMD ["executable","param1","param2"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)
 		    2-:CMD ["param1","param2"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
    		3-:CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)  	

    		like :
    		CMD ["bin/ping", "localhost"]
