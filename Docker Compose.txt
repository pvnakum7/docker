Docker Compose


Docker Compose 

--->Use for many applications consist of a collection of multiple containers running different software and interacting with one another. 

--->These complex applications can become difficult to maintain when all of their components are managed separately. 
--->Docker Compose offers a solution to this problem by allowing you to declaratively describe a set of multiple resources and manage them as a unit
