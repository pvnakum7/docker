Default Docker Engine Security


----->Namespaces an control Groups (Cgroups)
provide isolation to containers.

----->Isolation means that container processes
cannot see or effect other containers or rocesses
runing directly on the host system.


----->This limits the imapct of certain exploits
or privilege escalation attacks.

******************
Only allow trusted users to access the deamon.
******************************


Docker uses capabilities to fines-tune what container
propcesses can access.
