Docker Stacks


-----------> Stacks allow you to easily manage complex, multi-container applications and orchestrate them within your swarm cluster

-->The Docker Stack functionality, is included with the Docker engine.

--->You don't need to install additional packages to use it Deploying 
docker stacks is part of the swarm mode



----->Create a compose file for the stack.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo Hello!; sleep 10; done"

----->Deploy the stack and examine it using various commands.

 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
 docker stack ls
 docker stack ps simple
 docker stack services simple

---->Logs Check conitaner running in stack service

 docker service logs simple_busybox

----->Modify the stack to use an environment variable.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!
 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
 docker service logs simple_busybox

----->Modify the stack to expose a port.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
     ports:
     - "8080:80"
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!
 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
 curl localhost:8080

----->Modify the stack to use the BusyBox service to communicate with the web service.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
     ports:
     - "8080:80"
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; curl web:80; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!
 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple

----->Delete the stack.

 docker stack rm simple
