Docker High Availability in a Swarm Cluster


Docker recommends that you  distribute your manager nodes across at least 3 availability zones.






for example:


node manager.                 Availibility zone 
								Distribution
	3								1 - 1 - 1
	5								2 - 2 - 1
	7								3 - 2 - 2
	9								3 - 3 - 3
