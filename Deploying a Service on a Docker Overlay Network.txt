Deploying a Service on a Docker Overlay Network


You can create a network with the overlay driver to provide
connectivity between services and conitaines in Docker Swarm.

By daufault, services are attanched to a default 
overlay networrk called ingress.




--->List the networks on the host. You should be able to see the default ingress overlay network.

 docker network ls


-->Create an attachable overlay network.

 docker network create --driver overlay --attachable my-overlay


--->Create a service that uses that network, then test the network by attaching a container to it and using the container to communicate with the service.

 docker service create --name overlay-service --network my-overlay --replicas 3 nginx
 
 docker run --rm --network my-overlay radial/busyboxplus:curl curl overlay-service:80
