Docker Locking and Unlocking a Swarm Cluster


---->Docker supports the ability to securely store certain encryption keys

---->Autolock allows for greater security for these keys, but requires each manager to be unlocked whenever Docker restarts.

---->In this lesson, we will discuss autolock. 
Demonstrate how to enable and disable autolock,
as well as how to use it when it is enabled.


---->Enable autolock.

 docker swarm update --autolock=true


 ---->Make note of the unlock key!

--->Run a command to interact with the swarm, then restart docker and try the command again to verify that the swarm is locked.

 docker node ls

----> First Docker Stop

 sudo systemctl restart docker
 
 docker node ls

--->Unlock the swarm using the unlock key and verify that it is unlocked.

 docker swarm unlock
 
 docker node ls

---->Obtain the existing unlock key.

 docker swarm unlock-key

---->Rotate the unlock key.

 docker swarm unlock-key --rotate
****************************
---->Disable autolock.
****************************

 docker swarm update --autolock=false

---->Restart Docker
 
 sudo systemctl restart docker
 
 docker node ls
